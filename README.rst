Notes & documents related to my new role: 
SocioEconomic Justice Cleric.
=========
I reserve the right to multiclass. Or, I could just add new domains.

I'm currently defining "cleric" by the D&D 5e rules. I may add some 3.5 or Pathfinder rule options too.

I'm not sure HOW that's going to relate to REAL life. I'll work that out when I get there.
